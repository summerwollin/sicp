As I work through the Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs MIT course I will be publishing my answers in this repo. This is so that I can keep track of my work and progress throughout the course. My goal is to better understand computer programs and algorithms by learning Lisp. Checkout the course here: [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - Course Home](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/index.htm)
